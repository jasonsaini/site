KnowGap, developed as part of a team with myself as PM and full-stack developer, integrates seamlessly with Canvas to provide real-time at-risk student prediction using a custom algorithm. It curates personalized academic content through GPT and YouTube recommendations based on assessment performance, using data driven insights to help students at risk of failing their classes.
