Implemented a fake news detector using Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and Deep Neural Network to classify real and fake news. This project is part of a larger group of practical problems I've tackled using machine learning concepts such as exploratory data analysis, linear regression, classification, and K-means clustering.
