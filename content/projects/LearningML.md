I've completed several projects to get hands-on with different machine learning algorithms. From exploring data patterns and predicting customer behavior to clustering candidates and detecting fake news with deep learning, this journey has been both challenging and rewarding. My favorite project was building a high-performance fake news detector using NLP and neural networks.
